Why don't we have finite amount of prime numbers.

I met a friend who told me that the earliest proof goes to 400 BC

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_theorem#:~:text=Euler's%20proof,-Another%20proof%2C%20by&text=The%20sum%20on%20the%20right,an%20infinite%20number%20of%20primes.

Euclid's Proof is that we multiple all the primes we know. then we add 1. This new number is not divisible by any of the primes we already now
so it must be itself a prime
or divisible by a prime that is not in the list

I wanted to see is this new number a prime itself

That's what this program does
